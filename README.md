## Description & Motivation
This application is a simple tool for users to find musical events in their local area using Ticketmaster, YouTube, and LocationIQ's API. All you as the user needs to do is type in a city, click on an event/artist that appeals to you, and the location of venue will pop up with some videos from YouTube of the artist selected! It's like Magic! 

Our motivation to develop the application was so that nobody has to go to a show that they dislike ever again!
