## Description & Motivation
This application is a simple tool for users to find musical events in their local area using Ticketmaster, YouTube, and LocationIQ's API. All you as the user needs to do is type in a city, click on an event/artist that appeals to you, and the location of venue will pop up with some videos from YouTube of the artist selected! It's like Magic! 

Our motivation to develop the application was so that nobody has to go to a show that they dislike ever again!

## Future Developments

We want the user to be able to search by address and zip code in future production. We want to be able to filter events by distance from location input. In the future we would like to be able to search events of specific music genres. We also want to sort and organize stored events by location and date.

## Credits
We had a TON of fun with creating this app! The credit goes out to the wonderful project members: Edyta Tarczynski, Sam Page, & Evan Bulliner! Without these group of people, none of this would be possible! We would also like to thank our TA's Jen, and Pat! We would like to thank our excellent instructor Lori! We did a lot of research on Ticketmaster, YouTube, and LocationIQ's API. We literally couldn't be happier with this group! Even in our times of despair, we smiled through the pain!
